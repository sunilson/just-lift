# Just Lift

Native Android app to use the Vitruvian Trainer "Just Lift Echo" mode without the official app or
any connectivity.

## Getting the app

At the moment only an apk download is available. Publishing to Google Play is too risky for me due
to legal reasons.

You can find the latest release here: https://github.com/sunilson/just-lift/releases

## Other modes

At the moment I have no plans to implement other modes like "Guided Workouts" or "Custom Workouts".

## iOS & Multiplatform

Could be done as well, as all used libraries would support Multiplatform. If enough interest exists
I might look into it.

## TODO
